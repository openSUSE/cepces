# Hostname of the Certificate Enrollment Policy (CEP) Server.
# Used to construct the URL to the CEP endpoint.
#
# Default: ca
server=ca

# This is the endpoint type. It can be either "Policy" where the server
# endpoint specified later will be used to look up enrollment endpoints, or it
# can be "Enrollment" to specify a direct endpoint (bypassing XCEP
# altogether.)
type=Policy

# This is the authentication mechanism used for connecting to the service
# endpoint. The following options are available:
#
# * Anonymous
#             Anonymous authentication (i.e. no authentication at all.) This
#             is discouraged and untested. It is only included for completness
#             as defined in the MS-XCEP specification.
# * Kerberos
#             Transport level authentication. This is the default where the
#             authentication is performed in the HTTP(s) layer.
# * UsernamePassword
#             Message level authentication. The credentials are used in the
#             message header for authentication.
# * Certificate
#             Transport level authentication. A client certificate is used
#             for TLS client authentication in the HTTPS layer.
#
# Default: Kerberos
auth=Kerberos

# This is the final URL of the Policy Provider endpoint.
#
# Default: https://${server}/ADPolicyProvider_CEP_${auth}/service.svc/CEP
endpoint=https://${server}/ADPolicyProvider_CEP_${auth}/service.svc/CEP

# Path to a CA bundle or directory containing certificates. If not specified,

# This is the openssl security level. The latest openssl sets the default to
# level 2, which disables some less secure ciphers. You may encounter an error
# of '[SSL: DH_KEY_TOO_SMALL] dh key too small' if this level is set to high
# for your server. If this happens, you can work around this issue by setting
# openssl_seclevel to 1.
